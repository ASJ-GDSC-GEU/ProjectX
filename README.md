Technology has revolutionized over a period of time. During this pandemic, there has been a significant increase in demand for online learning platforms. It has been a real 
struggle for both the teachers and the students, to find a platform for organized learning. And technology is seen as the only hope to overcome these hurdles and to continue
learnings even during the toughest times.

## ðŸ”® Application Link & Future Scope : 

The app is currently in the ```Alpha testing``` phase in Graphic Era University with a limited no. of users. You can access our app here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n2u5Umqvd6qStjrXvugRuhw0kQ3aCjKX?usp=sharing
(USE THE APP ONLY IN LIGHT MODE). 

Once the app is fully tested, we will be expanding to other neighboring universities to improve their online class systems. We are planning to introduce the following features: Â  
1. Video Meeting Functionality (which is currently removed due to large app size) for live classes.
2. Feature to submit the assignments in the app itself.
3. To expand it to other mentors and universities and build up a sort of learning community.
